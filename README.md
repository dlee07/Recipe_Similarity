# Recipe_Similarity

Built a web scraping program that scrapes recipes from https://www.allrecipes.com/. 
Used Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) to generate sentence embeddings and 
applied cosine similarity on the text of ingredients of all scraped recipes. 

In addition, a table deployed on Streamlit is available to see the top five similar recipes for each recipe
